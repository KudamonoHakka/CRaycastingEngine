# CRaycastingEngine
Raycasting is an old form of turning 2D graphics into an illusion of 3D graphics. Old but popular games that had used the ray casting technique included titles such as Doom (1993) and Wolfenstein 3D. The idea of this project was to see if it is possible to make an efficient rendering engine that utilizes ray casting that could be used for a variety of different applications
